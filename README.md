# CMAKE and OpenGL 

Welcome to my demo repository.
I made this repo to help students to initialize an OpenGl project without any need to copy lib and include file and also to fix any linker issues that may hppens.

## Steps
1. First download and install cmake form [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
2. Next restart your machine in order to add cmake to path.
3. download the repo form [here](https://github.com/AliIbrahim996/cmak_open_gl/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) 
4. run creat_project.bat
5. go the build directory and run Demo.sln
6. enjoy

**Note**
> Each time you need a new project just make  a copy of this demo and change the content of the cpp file then run creat_project.bat again
